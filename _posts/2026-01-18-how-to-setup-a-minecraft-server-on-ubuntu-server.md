# How to Set Up a Minecraft Server on Ubuntu Server

Minecraft is one of the most popular video games in the world, and many players enjoy running their own servers to create custom worlds and manage multiplayer gameplay. If you’re looking to host a Minecraft server on your own hardware, Ubuntu Server is an excellent choice due to its stability and flexibility. In this guide, we’ll walk through the process of installing and configuring a Minecraft server on your Ubuntu Server.

If you don't know how to install Ubuntu Server, you can check out the previous guide here.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

A running Ubuntu Server installation (follow our previous guide on how to install Ubuntu Server).

Java installed on your server, as Minecraft is built on Java.

A stable internet connection.

Access to SSH (or physical access) to your server.

Sufficient system resources for the Minecraft server (at least 2GB RAM for a small server).

Step 1: Update Your Server

Before starting the Minecraft installation, it’s important to ensure that your server is up to date. Run the following commands to update your package lists and upgrade any outdated software:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y


---

Step 2: Install Java

Minecraft requires Java to run. The recommended version is Java 17, but you can also use newer or older versions, as Minecraft has different Java compatibility. To install OpenJDK 17 on Ubuntu, run the following command:

sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the Java installation:

java -version

This should display the version of Java you just installed (e.g., openjdk 17).

Step 3: Create a Minecraft User

It's a good practice to run your Minecraft server under a dedicated user for security reasons. You can create a new user called minecraft as follows:

sudo adduser minecraft

You'll be prompted to set a password and provide additional information. After that, switch to the minecraft user:

sudo su - minecraft


---

Step 4: Download Minecraft Server

1. Go to the official Minecraft server download page and grab the latest server .jar file link.


2. On your server, use wget to download the Minecraft server .jar file:



wget https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/xxxxxxx/server.jar -O minecraft_server.jar

(Replace xxxxxxx with the actual version string from the download page.)


---

Step 5: Accept the EULA

Before running the Minecraft server, you need to accept the Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA).

1. Run the server once to generate the required files:



java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui

2. You’ll see an error message asking you to agree to the EULA. Open the eula.txt file generated by the server:



nano eula.txt

3. Change eula=false to eula=true to accept the EULA:



eula=true

Save and exit by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, and then Enter.


---

Step 6: Run the Minecraft Server

Now you can start the Minecraft server. Run the following command to start the server:

java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui

Explanation of the flags:

-Xmx1024M specifies the maximum memory allocation for the server (1GB in this case).

-Xms1024M specifies the initial memory allocation for the server.

nogui disables the graphical user interface, which is more resource-efficient for server usage.


The server will begin loading, and after a few moments, you'll be able to connect to it using your Minecraft client.


---

Step 7: Configure the Minecraft Server (Optional)

The server will generate a number of configuration files, including server.properties, where you can customize your server’s settings.

To modify the server settings, open server.properties:

nano server.properties

Here are some common settings you may want to modify:

level-name: The name of your world.

max-players: The maximum number of players allowed to connect to your server.

motd: The message of the day that appears in the server list.

difficulty: The difficulty level (0 = Peaceful, 1 = Easy, 2 = Normal, 3 = Hard).


After making changes, save and exit by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, and then Enter.


---

Step 8: Set Up a Systemd Service (Optional)

To make sure your Minecraft server runs automatically when the system starts, it’s a good idea to set it up as a systemd service. This allows you to start, stop, and manage the server easily.

1. Create a new service file:



sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service

2. Add the following configuration to the file:



[Unit]
Description=Minecraft Server
After=network.target

[Service]
User=minecraft
WorkingDirectory=/home/minecraft
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
Restart=on-failure
Nice=1
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

This configuration will start the server with the minecraft user, and it will automatically restart if the server crashes.

3. Reload the systemd configuration to apply the new service:



sudo systemctl daemon-reload

4. Enable and start the Minecraft service:



sudo systemctl enable minecraft
sudo systemctl start minecraft

5. You can now control the server with these commands:



Start the server: sudo systemctl start minecraft

Stop the server: sudo systemctl stop minecraft

Check the status of the server: sudo systemctl status minecraft



---

Step 9: Open the Necessary Ports

If you're hosting your server from a machine that’s behind a router or firewall, you need to open port 25565 to allow incoming connections.

To do this, you’ll need to access your router’s settings and forward port 25565 to your server's local IP address.

If you’re using a firewall on your server, you can open the port using ufw:

sudo ufw allow 25565


---

Step 10: Connect to Your Minecraft Server

Now that your Minecraft server is running, you can connect to it from the Minecraft game client.

1. Open Minecraft on your computer.


2. Click on Multiplayer and then Add Server.


3. Enter your server’s IP address (for example, 192.168.x.x:25565 for local network play or your external IP address for remote play).

# How to Install Windows on macOS Using Boot Camp
Running Windows on a Mac can be incredibly useful, whether you need it for specific applications or gaming. Using Boot Camp Assistant, you can install Windows alongside macOS and choose which operating system to use at startup. Follow these steps to set up your dual-boot system!
What You’ll Need:
A Mac with an Intel processor (Boot Camp doesn’t work with Apple Silicon Macs).
A Windows 10 or Windows 11 ISO file.
At least 64 GB of free storage (128 GB recommended for better performance).
A backup of your data (always a good idea before making major changes).
Step 1: Check Your Mac’s Compatibility
Before diving into the installation, make sure your Mac is compatible with Boot Camp. Boot Camp is only available on Intel-based Macs, so if you have an M1 or M2 Mac, you’ll need to explore alternatives like virtualization.
To check your Mac’s processor:
Click on the Apple menu in the top-left corner of your screen.
Select About This Mac.
In the window that appears, look for Chip. If it says "Apple M1" or "Apple M2," Boot Camp won’t work.
Step 2: Download the Windows ISO
To install Windows, you’ll need an official ISO file from Microsoft.
Go to the Microsoft website and download the Windows 10 or Windows 11 ISO.
Choose the version that fits your needs (Windows 10 is often preferred for older hardware).
Make sure to select the correct language and architecture (typically 64-bit).
Save the ISO file to your desktop or a folder that’s easy to find.
Step 3: Open Boot Camp Assistant
Boot Camp Assistant is the built-in tool for setting up Windows on your Mac.
Open Launchpad > Other > Boot Camp Assistant.
Boot Camp Assistant will guide you through the process of installing Windows.
Step 4: Partition Your Drive
Boot Camp needs to partition your drive so that both macOS and Windows can coexist.
When you launch Boot Camp Assistant, it will ask you to choose the Windows ISO file and partition size.
Select the Windows ISO you downloaded in Step 2.
Choose the partition size for Windows. Keep in mind that 64 GB is the minimum requirement, but allocating 128 GB or more will give you a better experience.
Once you’re happy with the partition size, click Install.
Step 5: Install Windows
Your Mac will restart and begin installing Windows.
After the restart, you’ll be prompted with the Windows installation screen.
Select your language, time, and keyboard layout.
When you reach the disk selection screen, select the partition labeled BOOTCAMP.
Make sure you don’t select macOS partition.
Click Next to begin the installation. Windows will copy files and restart several times during this process.
Step 6: Install Boot Camp Drivers
Once Windows is installed, you'll need to install drivers to make sure everything works (like Wi-Fi, sound, and the trackpad).
After the installation finishes, your Mac will boot into Windows.
Boot Camp will automatically open and prompt you to install drivers.
Follow the on-screen instructions to install all necessary drivers.
After the drivers are installed, your Mac will likely restart one final time.
Step 7: Switching Between macOS and Windows
Now that you’ve installed Windows, you’ll want to know how to switch between macOS and Windows whenever you restart your Mac.
To choose between macOS and Windows, restart your Mac.
Hold down the Option (⌥) key during startup.
You’ll see two options: one for macOS and one for Windows. Select the one you want to boot into.
Conclusion
You’ve successfully set up a dual-boot system with macOS and Windows! Now, you can enjoy the best of both worlds on your Mac. Whether you need to run Windows-specific apps or play games, you can switch between macOS and Windows with just a few clicks.
